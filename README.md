Pugin is the Parliamentary CLI. It allows you to programatically query [API data provided by UK Parliament](https://developer.parliament.uk/) and explore the data through a friendly UI.

> **Note:**
> Pugin is **not** an officially supported UK Parliament project.


## How To Use

```bash
$ npm i -g pugin
$ pugin <command>
```

> **Note:**
> Pugin uses emojis (unicode) which has limited support on some Windows terminal emulators. We recommend Windows Terminal, which provides full support.
